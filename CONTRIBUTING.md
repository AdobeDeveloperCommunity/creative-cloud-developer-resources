# Contributing

Thanks for your help! We welcome any contributions that can help other developers building or learning to build add-ons.

To add an entry that links to a published resource (i.e. YouTube, npm package, article):

- Edit the `README.md` file and add a bullet to the relevant section
  - Add new section if needed
- Use the following format:
    ```
    - [Title of resource](https://example.com/link-to-resource) - Short description of resource
    ```
- Place it at the top of the section (newest first)
- Submit a pull request

To add an entry that is _stored in this repo_ (i.e. samples, demos):

- Place in dedicated folder
- Add README and license
- Add entry to root README that links to the resource-specific README
- Submit a pull request

## From Contributor To Committer

We love contributions from our community! If you'd like to go a step beyond contributor
and become a committer with full write access and a say in the project, you must
be invited to the project. The existing committers employ an internal nomination
process that must reach lazy consensus (silence is approval) before invitations
are issued. If you feel you are qualified and want to get more deeply involved,
feel free to reach out to existing committers to have a conversation about that.
